                <p>A woman was shot during a drug deal turned robbery Friday morning in Auburn.</p>

                <p>According to Auburn Police, the victim, a woman in her mid-30s, met with two suspects – a white man in his mid-20s and a black woman in her mid-30s – in a vehicle in a parking lot in the 1400 block of Auburn Way South at 9:40 a.m. for a drug transaction.</p>

                <p>After the male suspect allegedly pulled a handgun, a fight broke out in the car. The man then exited the car and allegedly fired an unknown number of rounds at the victim, who was sitting in the driver's seat.</p>

                <p>The victim was hit in the neck and transported to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. Auburn Police did not have any information about the woman's condition.</p>

                <p>Both suspects attempted to flee the scene but were apprehended nearby by Auburn Police, who continue to investigate the case.</p>
